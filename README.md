# Pneumonia-Detection-from-chest-x-rays-using-CNN

The dataset can be downloaded from the kaggle website which can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

The dataset consists of training data, validation data, and testing data. The training data consists of 5,216 chest x-ray images with 3,875 images shown to have pneumonia and 1,341 images shown to be normal. The validation data is relatively small with only 16 images with 8 cases of pneumonia and 8 normal cases. The testing data consists of 624 images split between 390 pneumonia cases and 234 normal cases.

The model is able to achieve an accuracy of 92.46% which is good enough considering the size of data that is used.
